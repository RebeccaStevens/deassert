Allows for [programming with
assertions](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)>)/[invariant-based
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant-based_programming) during
development without slowing down production.

yarn add -D deassert

# Install with bun
bun add -D deassert
```

## Thinking about Invariants

Invariant checks in your code should be thought of as a way of saying:

> If this check fails, something is very wrong elsewhere in my code.

Do not try to recover from Assertion Errors. If your error is recoverable, use a different type of error object.

## Usage

You probably don't want to use this library in your development builds.
It's designed to be used in your production builds.

## Example

Given the following code that uses assertion calls to enforce known invariants,
some of which may be expensive (line 25):

```js
import { AssertionError, ok as assert, fail as assertNever } from "node:assert/strict";

const stack = [
  {
    type: "foo",
    children: [
      /* ... */
    ],
  },
];
const result = [];

try {
  do {
    const element = stack.pop() ?? assertNever("stack is empty (or contains undefined).");

    switch (element.type) {
      case "foo": {
        assert(children.every(isExpectedType), "unexpected child type.");
        stack.push(...children);
        break;
      }

      case "bar": {
        assert(element.children.length === 0, "bar elements should not have children.");
        result.push(element.data);
        break;
      }

      case "baz": {
        throw new Error("Not Implemented yet.");
      }

      default: {
        assertNever(`Unexpected type: "${element.type}"`);
      }
    }
  } while (stack.length > 0);

  console.log((assert(result.length > 0), result));
} catch (error) {
  assert(error instanceof Error, "Unexpected Error.");
  assert(!(error instanceof AssertionError), error);

  console.error(error);
}
```

This library will transform the code into essentially the following:

```js
const stack = [
  {
    type: "foo",
    children: [
      /* ... */
    ],
  },
];
const result = [];

try {
  do {
    const element = stack.pop();

    switch (element.type) {
      case "foo": {
        stack.push(...children);
        break;
      }

      case "bar": {
        result.push(element.data);
        break;
      }

      case "baz": {
        throw new Error("Not Implemented yet.");
      }
    }
  } while (stack.length > 0);

  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

## Similar Projects

This project was inspired by [Unassert](https://github.com/unassert-js/unassert)
which has the same objective as this project.

While unassert works by modifying the inputted AST, this library
works directly on the inputted code.
